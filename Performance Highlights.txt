QUESTION 6
For this question, refer to the Helicopter Racing League (HRL) case study. A recent finance audit of cloud infrastructure noted an exceptionally high number of Compute Engine instances are allocated to do video encoding and transcoding. You suspect that these Virtual Machines are zombie machines that were not deleted after their workloads completed. You need to quickly get a list of which VM instances are idle. What should you do?
A. Log into each Compute Engine instance and collect disk, CPU, memory, and network usage statistics for analysis.
B. Use the gcloud compute instances list to list the virtual machine instances that have the idle: true label set.
C. Use the gcloud recommender command to list the idle virtual machine instances.
D. From the Google Console, identify which Compute Engine instances in the managed instance groups are no longer responding to health check probes.

I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunities I've had during my time at HCL Tech. It's been a valuable experience, and I've had the chance to work with some wonderful colleagues. However, after careful consideration, I have decided to resign due to a salary misalignment. I believe this decision is in the best interest of my career goals and financial well-being. Thank you for the support and experiences I've gained during my time here.
